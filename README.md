# Scorekeeper

A little scoreboard web app to track the score of a Volleyball match. A user creates a match with two team names,  associated colors, and an optional location. Two links are generated; one for the scorekeeper(s) and another for the viewers. The match creator will send the viewer link to friends/family and click the scorekeeper link on their own device.

On the scorekeeper page, tapping or swiping up will increment the score for that team by one. Swiping down will decrement the score for that team by one. Tapping the set icon in the middle will open a dialog with buttons to start a new set or end the match.

On the viewer page, the same scoreboard is displayed, but there are no controls. Users will simply see a live updating view of the scores as the scorekeeper makes updates.

When the scorekeeper ends the match, all users are redirected to a match summary page that can be bookmarked for future reference.
