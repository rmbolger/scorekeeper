# Scorekeeper

A little scoreboard web app to track the score of a game such as Volleyball. A user creates a match with two team names and associated colors. Two links are generated; one for the scorekeeper(s) and another for the viewers. The match creator will send the viewer link to friends/family and click the scorekeeper link on their own device.

On the scorekeeper page, tapping or swiping up will increment the score for that team by one. Swiping down will decrement the score for that team by one. The Reset button in the middle will set both team scores back to zero.

On the viewer page, the same scoreboard is displayed, but there are no controls. Users will simply see a live updating view of the scores as the scorekeeper makes updates.
